    <div class="page-content">
        <p>In the 90ies <a href="http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html">Mark Weiser</a> coined 
the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing">Ubiquitous Computing</a>,
a vision of a world where we are surrounded by countless smart devices, which 
are connected and provide seamless and fluid interoperability. </p>
<p>In the last decade, we have made big steps in achieving Weisers vision.
The amount of 'smart, connected devices' we 
interact with on a daily basis has multiplied.<br />
On a typical day even a non-techie might use: a mobile phone, mp3 player, 
laptop, tablet, e-reader, work deskop PC and smart TV. </p>
<p>The coming revolution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a>
promises to advance us even further in the same direction.</p>
<p>But <em>how are we doing in terms of interoperability</em>?</p>
<p>Imagine these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You sit in some pub with a few friends.
You show them a video you filmed yesterday on your phone.
You're speakers are really bad, and you want to send it to a friend who has
better speakers.<br />
--&gt; You try to send the video over What's App. 
You discover you have no cell reception. You give up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are at a conference, about to give a talk. For some reason, 
your MacBook won't work with the projector. You want to copy the presentation 
to some other laptop. The WiFi is overloaded.<br />
--&gt; You spend 5 minutes finding someone who still carries a USB stick and 
use it to transfer the files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are in an airplane, and you have a bunch of company documents stored on 
your laptop, which you want to read on your tablet. 
You forgot your micro USB cable.<br />
--&gt; You curse yourself for forgetting to send yourself the documents with 
GMail and downloading them on the tablet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to take some pictures with your camera, edit them on your laptop
and then view them in a slideshow on your smart TV.<br />
--&gt; Take pictures. Plug in camera. Edit. Check if your local media server is
still running: Nope. Try to access your laptop from the TV with a Samba mount: Nope. Copy the pictuers to an SD card, insert it to your TV. Not working. Plug in your laptop to the TV: SUCCESS!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everytime I run into one of those situations, I just get really angry and 
frustrated.
Why is it still such a hassle to do accomplish these tasks, in 2016?</p>
<p>This <a href="https://xkcd.com/949/">XKCD</a> catpures it well:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/file_transfer.png" alt="XKCD 949" title="XKCD 949 - File Transfer" /></p>
<p>We are starting to use more and more devices everyday, but the software they are
running is not designed with interoperability as a first class concern or goal.</p>
<p>There is an endless amount of file sharing apps for iOS and Android.
There are countless protocols and options for discovering devices and sharing files,
including &quot;ancient&quot; options like Samba, NFS and FTP or more recent ones like 
<a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/FTP.aspx">Bluetooth service discovery and File Transfer profile</a>.</p>
<p>But most solutions solutions require specific software to be installed on both devices.<br />
And other workarounds rely on internet connectivity and a centralized service, 
like Email, messenger apps or Dropbox.</p>
<p>What the world really needs is a universally accepted protocol for device discovery
and file sharing, which works over different communication channels (Bluetooth, WiFi) 
and is installed by default on every device.</p>
