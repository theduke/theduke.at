I'm a huge fan of [DEFCon](https://www.defcon.org/), and I'm planning on 
attending next year for the first time.

The talks are often very interesting, on the edge and enlightening. Also, how 
could you not love a conference where first time speakers have to drink a shot
on stage during their presentation? 

A lot of the talks are made available on YouTube. But not right away.  
The company doing the recording get's a chance the sell the videos at
[defcononline.com](https://www.defcononline.com).

While most of the talks probably won't be available until the end of the year,
DEFCon is publishing them one by one, so I've created a playlist on YT, which 
I will update whenever new videos come out.
